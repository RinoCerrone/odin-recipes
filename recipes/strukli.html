    <p>Strukli or maybe better said Zagorski strukli is a popular traditional dish in Croatia.
        The easiest way to describe them is that these tasty treats are a phyllo dough filled
        with fresh cottage cheese.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Dough:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>5 Tbls. oil</li>
        <li>300 ml warm water</li>
        <li>1 Tbls. white vinegar</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Extra oil</li>      
    </ul>
    <h5>Filling:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g fresh cottage cheese </li>
        <li>100 g butter </li>
        <li>100 ml sour cream </li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>       
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: mix together the flour and salt and then pour in warm water, vinegar, and oil. Knead the dough with hands until it's smooth-it should be smooth and elastic, not too soft and sticky. Brush the dough with oil and cover and place in a warm spot for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: Mix together the fresh cottage cheese, sour cream, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Take a clean tablecloth and dust with some flour. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin until thin and then begin stretching it with your palms and tip of your fingers. Stretch it from the middle until you make it very thin, almost that you can see through it. Cut out thick edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dough with melted butter. Put the filling over the one side of the dough. Roll it, using the tablecloth.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, separate the dough into equal parts and cut them with a plate. Cutting with a plate is a great way to firmly seal the edges and ensure the filling doesn't pour out.</li>
        <li>Cook the strukli in heated and salted water for around 2-3 minutes until they float to the top.</li>
        <li>You can serve the strukli when cooked in the salted water - though there are also a few other ways of serving them. One way is to bake the strukli covered with sour cream for 15 minutes on 200C, alternately heat a little butter in a pan with some breadcrumbs and add the strukli to the pan for a minute just enough time to coat them with buttery crumbs.</li>
               
    </ol>
