    <h1>Ajvar</h1>
    <img src="///home/tkoma/repos/odin-recipes/images/domaci_ajvar_recept.jpg">
    <p>Traditional Croatian roasted pepper mixture, 
       sometimes referred to as vegetarian caviar. 
       It’s actually typical for the cuisine of the entire Balkan area,
       usually made in mid-autumn and consumed throughout the year.</p>
    <p>The type of pepper used for ajvar is called roga, meaning horned — it is large, red, horn-shaped, with thick flesh and relatively easy to peel. </p>
    <p>You can make ajvar sweet, piquant or very hot. 
       Its smoky flavor is a great match for grilled or roasted meats, especially lamb.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>22 lbs (10 kg) red roga peppers</li>
        <li>5.5 lbs (2.5 kg) eggplant</li>
        <li>3 or 4 chili peppers</li>
        <li>27 oz (800 ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3.3 oz (100 ml) vinegar</li>
        <li>4-5 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>5 tbsp salt</li>      
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To grill the eggplants, make sure you poke holes with a knife, so they don't explode. Grill them until soft and charred. After the eggplants have cooled off, remove the peel, using a knife, if you've cooked them enough, the peel should come off easily. Do the same with peppers. Let cool and remove all the peel and seeds from them and wash them well.</li>
        <li>Place the eggplant in a colander and let it drain off any excess water. Do the same with the peppers. This may take about half hour or so.</li>
        <li>The next step you can do in small batches, depends how big your food processor is (you can also use the mill), but place some eggplant and pepper, garlic cloves and chili peppers into the food processor and pulse a few times until they are finely chopped.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Add peppers and eggplant and stir using a wooden spoon. Add salt and vinegar and cook stirring. This will require 3 hours of cooking over low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, I stirred every 10 minutes, just so that it doesn't stick to the bottom.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, boil the jars in hot water first for about 10 minutes. After that, just before the spread is ready to be canned, you place the jars, lids off, in the oven at 180 F degrees for 10 minutes. Take them out and carefully fill the jars so that there is about an inch left from the top, place the lid onto the rim and twist on the screw band until it’s tight. Place the jars back in the oven and continue baking for another 15 minutes, after which you can turn off the oven, and let them cool in there.</li>
               
    </ol>
